# My Advanced Blog

This is a refactored version of a simple blog project using HTML, Bootstrap, and custom CSS. The blog structure follows best practices for accessibility and responsive design. The CSS is moved to an external file for maintainability, and performance optimizations are applied.


### Key Features

- **Semantic HTML Structure**: The blog uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` elements to ensure semantic structure and accessibility (a11y).
- **Responsive Design**: The project is built with Bootstrap5 to ensure responsive design across all screen sizes.
- **External CSS with Variables**: The styles are moved to an external CSS file, using CSS variables for color consistency and maintainability.
- **"Back to Top" Button**: A button appears when the user scrolls down the page to easily navigate back to the top.
- **Non-blocking CSS**: CSS is loaded asynchronously to improve initial page rendering speed.
- **Accessible Navigation Menu**: A responsive, accessible navigation menu is implemented using Bootstrap's Navbar component.
- **Simple Contact Form**: A contact form is added in the footer for users to reach out.
